POST request: create resource (not idenmpotent)
GET request: read resource (idempotent)
PUT request: update resource (idempotent)
DELETE request: delete resource (idempotent)

idempotent = making multiple requests has the same
effect as making one effect

200-level code = SUCCESS
400 = something wrong with the request (ex: syntax)
500 = something wrong on server level
